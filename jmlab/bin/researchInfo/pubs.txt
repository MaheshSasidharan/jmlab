Cntnap2 Knockout Rats and Mice Exhibit Epileptiform Activity and Abnormal Sleep-Wake Physiology.	Although recent innovations have enabled modification of the rat genome, it is unclear whether enhanced utility of rodents as human disease models will result. We compared electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral phenotypes of rats and mice with homozygous deletion of Cntnap2, a gene associated with cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy (CDFE) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).Male contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Cntnap2) knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) rats and male Cntnap2 KO and WT mice were implanted with telemeters to record EEG, electromyogram, body temperature, and locomotor activity. Animals were subjected to a test battery for ASD-related behaviors, followed by 24-hr EEG recordings that were analyzed for sleep-wake parameters and subjected to spectral analysis.Cntnap2 KO rats exhibited severe motor seizures, hyperactivity, and increased consolidation of wakefulness and REM sleep. By contrast, Cntnap2 KO mice demonstrated absence seizure-like events, hypoactivity, and wake fragmentation. Although seizures observed in Cntnap2 KO rats were more similar to those in CDFE patients than in KO mice, neither model fully recapitulated the full spectrum of disease symptoms. However, KOs in both species had reduced spectral power in the alpha (9-12 Hz) range during wake, suggesting a conserved EEG biomarker.Deletion of Cntnap2 impacts similar behaviors and EEG measures in rats and mice, but with profound differences in nature and phenotypic severity. These observations highlight the importance of cross-species comparisons to understand conserved gene functions and the limitations of single- species models to provide translational insights relevant to human diseases.	https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28364455	Thomas, Alexia M; Schwartz, Michael D; Saxe, Michael D; Kilduff, Thomas S	Sleep	20170401	28364455	NA	Journal Article
Multi-Echo fMRI: A Review of Applications in fMRI Denoising and Analysis of BOLD Signals.	In recent years the field of fMRI research has enjoyed expanded technical abilities related to resolution, as well as use across many fields of brain research. At the same time, the field has also dealt with uncertainty related to many known and unknown effects of artifact in fMRI data. In this review we discuss an emerging fMRI technology, called multi-echo (ME)-fMRI, which focuses on improving the fidelity and interpretability of fMRI. Where the essential problem of standard single-echo fMRI is the indeterminacy of sources of signals, whether BOLD or artifact, this is not the case for ME-fMRI. By acquiring multiple echo images per slice, the ME approach allows T2⁎ decay to be modeled at every voxel at every time point. Since BOLD signals arise by changes in T2⁎ over time, an fMRI experiment sampling the T2⁎ signal decay can be analyzed to distinguish BOLD from artifact signal constituents. While the ME approach has a long history of use in theoretical and validation studies, modern MRI systems enable whole-brain multi-echo fMRI at high resolution. This review covers recent multi-echo fMRI acquisition methods, and the analysis steps for this data to make fMRI at once more principled, straightforward, and powerful. After a brief overview of history and theory, T2⁎ modeling and applications will be discussed. These applications include T2⁎ mapping and combining echoes from ME data to increase BOLD contrast and mitigate dropout artifacts. Next, the modeling of fMRI signal changes to detect signal origins in BOLD-related T2⁎ versus artifact-related S0 changes will be reviewed. A focus is on the use of ME-fMRI data to extract and classify components from spatial ICA, called multi-echo ICA (ME-ICA). After describing how ME-fMRI and ME-ICA lead to a general model for analysis of fMRI signals, applications in animal and human imaging will be discussed. Applications include removing motion artifacts in resting state data at subject and group level. New imaging methods such as multi-band multi-echo fMRI and imaging at 7T are demonstrated throughout the review, and a practical analysis pipeline is described. The review culminates with evidence from recent studies of major boosts in statistical power from using multi-echo fMRI for detecting activation and connectivity in healthy individuals and patients with neuropsychiatric disease. In conclusion, the review shows evidence that the multi-echo approach expands the range of experiments that is practicable using fMRI. These findings suggest a compelling future role of the multi-echo approach in subject-level and clinical fMRI.Copyright © 2017.

The Davida Teller Award Lecture, 2016: Visual Brain Development: A review of "Dorsal Stream Vulnerability"-motion, mathematics, amblyopia, actions, and attention.	Research in the Visual Development Unit on "dorsal stream vulnerability' (DSV) arose from research in two somewhat different areas. In the first, using cortical milestones for local and global processing from our neurobiological model, we identified cerebral visual impairment in infants in the first year of life. In the second, using photo/videorefraction in population refractive screening programs, we showed that infant spectacle wear could reduce the incidence of strabismus and amblyopia, but many preschool children, who had been significantly hyperopic earlier, showed visuo-motor and attentional deficits. This led us to compare developing dorsal and ventral streams, using sensitivity to global motion and form as signatures, finding deficits in motion sensitivity relative to form in children with Williams syndrome, or perinatal brain injury in hemiplegia or preterm birth. Later research showed that this "DSV" was common across many disorders, both genetic and acquired, from autism to amblyopia. Here, we extend DSV to be a cluster of problems, common to many disorders, including poor motion sensitivity, visuo-motor spatial integration for planning actions, attention, and number skills. In current research, we find that individual differences in motion coherence sensitivity in typically developing children are correlated with MRI measures of area variations in parietal lobe, fractional anisotropy (from TBSS) of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and performance on tasks of mathematics and visuo-motor integration. These findings suggest that individual differences in motion sensitivity reflect decision making and attentional control rather than integration in MT/V5 or V3A. Its neural underpinnings may be related to Duncan's "multiple-demand" (MD) system.	https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362900	Atkinson, Janette	J Vis	20170331	28362900	NA	Journal Article
Talin gets SHANKed in the fight for integrin activation.	Genetic mutations in the SHANK family of proteins are linked to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorders.

Multi-scale radiomic analysis of sub-cortical regions in MRI related to autism, gender and age.	We propose using multi-scale image textures to investigate links between neuroanatomical regions and clinical variables in MRI. Texture features are derived at multiple scales of resolution based on the Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filter. Three quantifier functions (Average, Standard Deviation and Entropy) are used to summarize texture statistics within standard, automatically segmented neuroanatomical regions. Significance tests are performed to identify regional texture differences between ASD vs. TDC and male vs. female groups, as well as correlations with age (corrected p < 0.05). The open-access brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE) brain MRI dataset is used to evaluate texture features derived from 31 brain regions from 1112 subjects including 573 typically developing control (TDC, 99 females, 474 males) and 539 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD, 65 female and 474 male) subjects. Statistically significant texture differences between ASD vs. TDC groups are identified asymmetrically in the right hippocampus, left choroid-plexus and corpus callosum (CC), and symmetrically in the cerebellar white matter. Sex-related texture differences in TDC subjects are found in primarily in the left amygdala, left cerebellar white matter, and brain stem. Correlations between age and texture in TDC subjects are found in the thalamus-proper, caudate and pallidum, most exhibiting bilateral symmetry.	https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28361913	Chaddad, Ahmad; Desrosiers, Christian; Toews, Matthew	Sci Rep	20170331	28361913	NA	Journal Article
Simplifying study of fever's dramatic relief of autistic behavior.	Dramatic relief of autistic behavior by infectious fever continues to tantalize parents and practitioners, yet researchers still hesitate to study its physiology/biochemistry, fearing stress and heat of brain imaging, contagion, and fever's complexity. Yet what could be more revealing than a common event that virtually 'normalizes' autistic behavior for a time? This paper proposes study of three simplified scenarios: (1) improvements appearing hours before fever, (2) return of autistic behavior soon after fever, (3) improvements persisting long after fever. Each scenario limits some risk - and some explanation - inviting triangulation of decisive factor(s) in relief and recurrence. Return of autistic behavior after fever may be most revealing. The complex mechanisms that generated fever have all abated; simpler cooling mechanisms prevail - how many plausible explanations can there be? The decisive factor in fever's benefit is concluded to be water drawn/carried from brain myelin and astrocytes by osmolytes glutamine and taurine released from muscles and brain; the decisive factor in return of autistic behavior after fever is return of water.Copyright © 2016 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Exploring the Interaction of Motor and Social Skills With Autism Severity Using the SFARI Dataset.	Social communicative deficits and stereotyped or repetitive interests or behaviors are the defining features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A growing body of research suggests that gross motor deficits are also present in most children with ASD. This study sought to understand how pediatric ASD severity is related to motor skills and social skills. A multivariate analysis of variance analysis of 483 children with autism ( N = 444) and ASD ( N = 39) revealed a nonsignificant difference between groups. Results suggest little difference between severity groups on gross motor and social skills within the limited age range of the participants (about 5.6 years of age).	https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28361650	Colombo-Dougovito, Andrew M; Reeve, Ronald E	Percept Mot Skills	20170331	28361650	NA	Journal Article
Impaired Recognition of Basic Emotions from Facial Expressions in Young People with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Assessing the Importance of Expression Intensity.	It has been proposed that impairments in emotion recognition in ASD are greater for more subtle expressions of emotion. We measured recognition of 6 basic facial expressions at 8 intensity levels in young people (6-16 years) with ASD (N = 63) and controls (N = 64) via an Internet platform. Participants with ASD were less accurate than controls at labelling expressions across intensity levels, although differences at very low levels were not detected due to floor effects. Recognition accuracy did not correlate with parent-reported social functioning in either group. These findings provide further evidence for an impairment in recognition of basic emotion in ASD and do not support the idea that this impairment is limited solely to low intensity expressions.	https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28361375	Griffiths, Sarah; Jarrold, Christopher; Penton-Voak, Ian S; Woods, Andy T; Skinner, Andy L; Munafò, Marcus R	J Autism Dev Disord	20170331	28361375	NA	Journal Article
A de novo splice site mutation in EHMT1 resulting in Kleefstra syndrome with pharmacogenomics screening and behavior therapy for regressive behaviors.	Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is a rare autosomal dominant developmental disability, caused by microdeletions or intragenic mutations within the epigenetic regulator gene EHMT1 (euchromatic histone lysine N-methyltransferase 1). In addition to common features of autism, young adult regressive behaviors have been reported. However, the genetic downstream effects of the reported deletions or mutations on KS phenotype have not yet been completely explored. While genetic backgrounds affecting drug metabolism can have a profound effect on therapeutic interventions, pharmacogenomic variations are seldom considered in directing psychotropic therapies.In this report, we used next-generation sequencing (exome sequencing and high-throughput RNA sequencing) in a patient and his parents to identify causative genetic variants followed by pharmacogenomics-guided clinical decision-making for making positive changes toward his treatment strategies. The patient had an early autism diagnosis and showed significant regressive behaviors and physical aberrations at age 23.Exome sequencing identified a novel, de novo splice site variant NM_024757.4: c.2750-1G>T in EHMT1, a candidate gene for Kleefstra syndrome, in the patient that results in exon skipping and downstream frameshift and termination. Gene expression results from the patient showed, when compared to his parents, there was a significant decreased expression of several reported gene variants associated with autism risk. Further, using a pharmacogenomics genotyping panel, we discovered that the patient had the CYP2D6 nonfunctioning variant genotype *4/*4 that results in very low metabolic activity on a number of psychotropic drugs, including fluvoxamine which he was prescribed. As reported here, a change in psychotropic drugs and intense behavior therapies resulted in a significant reversal of the regressive behaviors and physical aberrations.These results demonstrate an individualized approach that integrated genetic information and behavior therapies, resulting in a dramatic improvement in regressive behaviors associated with KS.	https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28361099	Mitra, Amit Kumar; Dodge, Jessica; Van Ness, Jody; Sokeye, Israel; Van Ness, Brian	Mol Genet Genomic Med	20170331	28361099	5370220	Journal Article
Dynamic Akt/mTOR Signaling in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined disorder affecting 1 in 68 children. Currently, there is no known cause for the majority of ASD cases nor are there physiological diagnostic tools or biomarkers to aid behavioral diagnosis. Whole-genome linkage studies, genome-wide association studies, copy number variation screening, and SNP analyses have identified several ASD candidate genes, but which vary greatly among individuals and family clusters, suggesting that a variety of genetic mutations may result in a common pathology or alter a common mechanistic pathway. The Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is involved in many cellular processes including synaptic plasticity and immune function that can alter neurodevelopment. In this study, we examined the activity of the Akt/mTOR pathway in cells isolated from children with ASD and typically developing controls. We observed higher activity of mTOR, extracellular receptor kinase, and p70S6 kinase and lower activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)α and tuberin (TSC2) in cells from children with ASD. These data suggest a phosphorylation pattern indicative of higher activity in the Akt/mTOR pathway in children with general/idiopathic ASD and may suggest a common pathological pathway of interest for ASD.	https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28361047	Onore, Charity; Yang, Houa; Van de Water, Judy; Ashwood, Paul	Front Pediatr	20170331	28361047	5350147	Journal Article
